Problem:
A floor plan is an abstract representation of a building floor and defined by the distribution of walls and space.  For this project, floor plans are represented by ASCII characters, with walls being “#” and empty spaces being “ “ (white space). A room is defined by a cluster of adjacent spaces surrounded by walls and doors. A door is defined by a single space that divides two collinear walls.
